# 🔍 Single Number Problem

## 📋 Problem Description

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears **twice** except for one. Find that single unique element.

You must implement a solution with:
- **Linear runtime complexity**.
- **Constant extra space**.

## 💡 Examples

- **Example 1:**
    - Input: `nums = [2, 2, 1]`
    - Output: `1`

- **Example 2:**
    - Input: `nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]`
    - Output: `4`

- **Example 3:**
    - Input: `nums = [1]`
    - Output: `1`

## 📜 Constraints

- The length of `nums` will be between `1` and `3 * 10^4`.
- Each element in `nums` will be between `-3 * 10^4` and `3 * 10^4`.
- Every element appears **twice**, except for one element which appears only once.
