# Java Streams Overview üåä

Java Streams, introduced in **Java 8**, provide a modern and functional approach to processing collections of objects. They support various operations like filtering, mapping, and reduction, allowing developers to handle data processing tasks in a more concise and readable way.

## üß© **1. What Are Streams?**

Streams represent a sequence of elements supporting sequential and parallel aggregate operations. A stream does not store data but instead performs operations on the underlying data source (such as collections, arrays, or I/O channels). A stream pipeline consists of three components:
- **Source**: The data source like a collection or array.
- **Intermediate Operations**: Operations that transform the stream, like `filter()` or `map()`. They are lazy, meaning they are not executed until a terminal operation is invoked.
- **Terminal Operations**: Operations that produce a result or a side-effect, like `collect()`, `forEach()`, or `reduce()`.

## üöÄ **2. Key Stream Operations**

Streams offer several operations to work on data efficiently. These operations fall into two categories: intermediate and terminal.

### **Intermediate Operations** (lazy evaluation):
- **filter()**: Selects elements based on a condition.
- **map()**: Transforms each element in the stream.
- **sorted()**: Sorts the elements.
- **distinct()**: Removes duplicates.

### **Terminal Operations** (triggers the stream pipeline):
- **forEach()**: Performs an action for each element.
- **collect()**: Gathers elements into a collection or another result structure.
- **reduce()**: Combines elements to produce a single result.
- **count()**: Returns the count of elements in the stream.

### Example:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Alice");

List<String> distinctSortedNames = names.stream()
    .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
    .distinct()
    .sorted()
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

System.out.println(distinctSortedNames); // Output: [Alice]
```

## üíª **3. Functional Programming with Streams**

Streams embrace **functional programming** concepts, making it easy to express complex data processing logic in a more declarative way. This is achieved through:
- **Lambdas**: Pass anonymous functions (lambda expressions) to operate on the elements.
- **Method References**: Use existing methods for stream operations, improving code reuse and readability.


```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

numbers.stream()
    .map(n -> n * 2)
    .forEach(System.out::println); // Output: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª **4. Parallel Streams**

Streams can be processed in parallel to leverage multi-core architectures. **Parallel streams** split the data source into multiple substreams, process them independently, and combine the results.

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Jack", "Jill");

names.parallelStream()
    .forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Benefits:
- Makes it easy to parallelize tasks with minimal code changes.
- Improves performance for computationally expensive tasks.

### When to use parallel streams:
- Suitable for CPU-bound tasks with large datasets.
- Not recommended for I/O-bound or low-latency tasks due to overhead from thread management.

## üìà **5. Stream Pipelines**

A **stream pipeline** is a chain of stream operations. Streams are lazy, meaning intermediate operations like filtering or mapping are not executed until a terminal operation is called. This allows optimizations, such as **short-circuiting** for operations like `findFirst()` and `anyMatch()`.

```java
Optional<String> first = names.stream()
    .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
    .findFirst();

first.ifPresent(System.out::println); // Output: John
```

## üß™ **6. Streams vs Collections**

While collections are in-memory data structures, streams focus on **processing data**. A few important distinctions:
- **Collections** are data structures, whereas **streams** are sequences of data.
- **Streams** are **lazily evaluated**, and operations are executed only when necessary, whereas collections store all elements.
- **Streams** support functional-style operations, which are declarative and more readable.

## üõ†Ô∏è **7. Common Use Cases for Streams**

- **Filtering data**: Select items based on a condition.
- **Transformation**: Convert data from one form to another.
- **Aggregation**: Sum, average, or combine values from a dataset.
- **Searching**: Find an element that matches a specific condition.
- **Parallel processing**: Efficiently process large datasets using parallel streams.
