# üìö Java Garbage Collection: A Beginner's Guide

Java provides a powerful memory management feature called **Garbage Collection (GC)**. It helps manage memory automatically by reclaiming memory that is no longer in use, preventing memory leaks, and optimizing performance. Let's dive into the basics of how it works!

## üß† What is Garbage Collection?

In Java, when objects are created using the `new` keyword, memory is allocated to them in the **heap memory**. However, Java programs do not explicitly manage memory. Instead, the **Garbage Collector (GC)** is responsible for automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer being used by the program.

This allows developers to focus on the logic of the program without worrying about memory allocation and deallocation, making Java **memory-safe**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Does Java Garbage Collection Work?

Garbage Collection in Java works by following these basic steps:

1. **Object Creation**: When a new object is created, memory is allocated for it in the **heap**.
2. **Object Reference**: If an object is referenced (i.e., still in use by the program), it remains in memory.
3. **Unreferenced Objects**: When there are no more references to an object, it becomes **eligible for garbage collection**. The Garbage Collector can then reclaim the memory.
4. **Automatic Reclamation**: Java's **Garbage Collector** runs periodically to clean up unused objects from the heap, freeing up memory for new objects.

## üîç Types of Garbage Collection Algorithms

Java uses different types of **GC algorithms** to efficiently manage memory. Here are some common ones:

### **1. Serial Garbage Collector**
   - **Simple** and suitable for small applications.
   - Uses a **single thread** to perform garbage collection.
   
### **2. Parallel Garbage Collector**
   - Uses **multiple threads** to speed up the garbage collection process.
   - Suitable for multi-threaded applications that require higher throughput.

### **3. G1 Garbage Collector**
   - The **Garbage First (G1)** collector is designed for applications that require both high throughput and low pause times.
   - Divides the heap into regions and prioritizes the collection of regions with the most garbage.

### **4. Z Garbage Collector (ZGC)**
   - A **low-latency** collector designed for applications that require minimal pause times.
   - Suitable for large heap sizes and modern applications that demand high performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phases of Garbage Collection

The garbage collection process typically has two main phases:

### **1. Mark Phase**:
   - The GC **marks all objects** that are still referenced and reachable in the heap.
   - Unreferenced objects are not marked.

### **2. Sweep Phase**:
   - The GC **removes unmarked objects** and reclaims their memory.
   - The memory is then available for new objects.

Some collectors may also have **compact phases** to defragment the heap and optimize space.

## üìà Generational Garbage Collection

Java heap memory is divided into **generations** based on the age of objects:

### **1. Young Generation**:
   - Newly created objects are placed here.
   - Garbage Collection is frequent in this space, as most objects die quickly (known as **Minor GC**).

### **2. Old Generation (Tenured Space)**:
   - Objects that survive multiple collections in the young generation are moved here.
   - Garbage Collection in this space is less frequent (known as **Major GC** or **Full GC**).

### **3. Permanent Generation (Metaspace)**:
   - Stores metadata such as class definitions.
   - Since Java 8, this area is managed in a space called **Metaspace**, which is separate from the heap.

## ‚ú® Key Points to Remember

- **Automatic**: Garbage Collection is handled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), so developers don‚Äôt have to manage memory manually.
- **Efficiency**: GC helps in **preventing memory leaks** by automatically reclaiming memory.
- **Performance**: Different GC algorithms can be chosen based on application needs (e.g., throughput, low latency).
- **Tuning**: JVM provides options to tune the GC behavior, like setting heap sizes or selecting the appropriate garbage collector for your app.

## üí° Conclusion

Java‚Äôs Garbage Collection is an essential part of the JVM that helps manage memory efficiently. Automatically identifying and removing unused objects allows developers to write memory-safe applications without manually managing memory allocation and deallocation. Understanding how it works at a basic level can help tune and improve the performance of Java applications.
