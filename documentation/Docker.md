# üê≥ Docker Overview and Key Concepts

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows you to package an application along with its dependencies into a standardized unit (container), ensuring that it runs consistently across different computing environments.

## üöÄ Key Docker Concepts

1. **Image**: A Docker image is a read-only template with instructions to create a container. Think of it as a blueprint for your application that includes the app itself, the runtime environment (like Java), system libraries, and tools.

2. **Container**: A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can have many containers running the same image. Containers are lightweight and isolated, ensuring that they work consistently regardless of where they run.

3. **Dockerfile**: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains all the commands to assemble an image. You use a Dockerfile to define how the environment is set up, such as installing Java, copying application files, and running the app.

4. **Registry**: A centralized location where Docker images are stored. The most popular one is Docker Hub, where you can upload, download, and share images.

5. **Volume**: Docker volumes are used to store data persistently, independent of the container lifecycle.

6. **Network**: Docker provides networking features that allow containers to communicate with each other or with the outside world.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example: Dockerizing a Java Application

Below is an example of using Docker to run a simple Java application.

### üìù Sample Java Application

Let‚Äôs assume we have a simple Java program (`Main.java`) that prints "Hello, Docker!".

### üê≥ Writing a Dockerfile for Java Application

A `Dockerfile` is needed to create a Docker image for your Java app. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step explanation of how the Dockerfile is structured.

```
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:17-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Compile the Java program
RUN javac Main.java

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["java", "Main"]
```

üö® Key Dockerfile Instructions

**FROM**: This specifies the base image. In this case, we are using the openjdk:17-alpine image, which includes Java 17 on a lightweight Alpine Linux distribution.

**WORKDIR**: This sets the working directory inside the container. All following commands will be run inside this directory.

**COPY**: This copies the content from the current directory on your host machine to the container's /app directory.

**RUN**: This command executes a shell command inside the container. Here, we are compiling the Main.java file.

**CMD**: This defines the default command that gets executed when the container starts. In this case, it runs the Java program.

## üåü Building and Running the Docker Image

1. **Build the Docker Image**: Open a terminal in the directory containing your Dockerfile and Java program, then run the appropriate command to build the image.

```
docker build -t my-java-app .
```

2. **Run the Docker Container**: Once the image is built, you can create and run a container from it. The output should show "Hello, Docker!".

```
docker run my-java-app
```

This will start a container, execute the java Main command inside it, and you should see the output:

```
Hello, Docker!
```

## üõ† How Docker Works with Kubernetes (K8s)

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Docker and Kubernetes work together to manage containers across clusters of machines, providing powerful capabilities for modern microservices-based architectures.

### üéØ Key Concepts of Docker and Kubernetes Integration

1. **Containers as Pods**: In Kubernetes, containers are grouped into units called **Pods**. A Pod can contain one or more containers (usually tightly coupled), and all containers in a Pod share the same network and storage.

2. **Docker Images in K8s**: Docker images are used as the base for containers in Kubernetes Pods. When deploying an application in Kubernetes, the image is pulled from a Docker registry (like Docker Hub or a private registry) and then instantiated as a container inside a Pod.

3. **Kubernetes Nodes**: A **Node** in Kubernetes is a worker machine that runs your containers. Each Node runs a Docker engine (or another container runtime) to manage the containers in the Node. Kubernetes controls how containers are scheduled and run across Nodes.

4. **Container Lifecycle Management**: Docker containers managed by Kubernetes are created, started, stopped, and deleted based on configurations (like **Deployment**, **StatefulSet**, or **Job** resources). Kubernetes handles container health checks, restarts failed containers, and scales up or down based on demand.

5. **Networking**: Docker provides internal container networks for communication. Kubernetes abstracts this further by providing a **Cluster IP** for services, allowing Pods to communicate across Nodes, and **Ingress** for external access.

6. **Volumes**: Both Docker and Kubernetes support volumes for persistent storage. Kubernetes allows for dynamic provisioning of storage resources through **Persistent Volumes** (PV) and **Persistent Volume Claims** (PVC), making it easy to manage stateful applications in a Docker container.

### üåê Example: Deploying Dockerized Java App in Kubernetes

Let‚Äôs extend the Dockerized Java app to run in Kubernetes. Below is a simplified example flow:

1. **Create Docker Image**: Build a Docker image for the Java app as shown in the previous Docker section.

2. **Push Docker Image**: Push the Docker image to a registry, such as Docker Hub, so Kubernetes can pull the image when deploying the app.

3. **Create Kubernetes Deployment**: 

   A **Deployment** in Kubernetes manages the deployment of Pods, ensuring the desired number of Pods is always running. You will create a YAML configuration file for the Deployment, which defines how your Dockerized Java application will be deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.

 ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: java-app-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: java-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: java-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: java-app-container
           image: <your-dockerhub-username>/my-java-app:latest
           ports:
           - containerPort: 8080
```

Key Concepts:

**replicas**: This defines the number of Pods to run (in this case, 3 replicas).

**image**: The Docker image to use for the container. You should replace <your-dockerhub-username> with your actual Docker Hub username.

**containerPort**: The port inside the container that your Java app listens on.

4. **Create a Kubernetes Service**:

   A **Service** is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. It allows your application to communicate with other apps or be accessible externally.
 
 ```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: java-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: java-app
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```
5. **Deploy to Kubernetes**:

   After creating the necessary YAML files (deployment.yaml and service.yaml), deploy your Java app in Kubernetes using the `kubectl` command:

### üîÑ Docker, Kubernetes, and Scaling

One of the powerful features of Kubernetes is the ability to scale your application horizontally by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas.

- **Scaling**: You can scale the number of replicas of your application dynamically based on traffic or resource usage using the `kubectl scale` command.
---

### üì¶ Docker vs. Kubernetes in a Nutshell

- **Docker**: Provides the container runtime, allowing you to package and run applications in isolated environments (containers). It ensures your app runs consistently across different environments.
  
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestrates and manages multiple containers across a distributed cluster. It provides high-level features like self-healing, scaling, service discovery, load balancing, and more. Docker containers are one of the most popular runtimes used in Kubernetes, but K8s can also support other container runtimes.

Together, Docker and Kubernetes form a powerful ecosystem that supports modern microservices architectures by enabling scalability, fault tolerance, and portability across cloud platforms.

### üß† Key Kubernetes Resources for Dockerized Apps

1. **Pod**: A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It can run one or more containers (usually one Docker container per Pod).
2. **Deployment**: Manages the deployment and scaling of Pods. It ensures that the correct number of Pods is running and handles rolling updates or rollbacks.
3. **Service**: Exposes Pods to the network, allowing internal and external communication with your containers.
4. **ConfigMap & Secrets**: Used to pass configuration and sensitive data to your containers, without hardcoding them into the image.
